# 🦈 Hungry Shark Dude: Reverse Engineered & Reimagined

Welcome to my personal project where I reverse engineer the classic **Game Boy** game *Fish Dude* and transform it into a gameplay experience inspired by the modern mobile hit *Hungry Shark*.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

**Fish Dude** is a 1992 Game Boy game featuring a small fish trying to survive in the ocean. This project aims to dissect the original game, understand its mechanics, and enhance it by introducing new gameplay elements, mechanics, and goals similar to the *Hungry Shark* series — where you grow by eating smaller fish and avoiding larger predators.
