# 🦈 Fish Dude: Reverse Engineered & Reimagined

Welcome to my personal project where I reverse engineer the classic **Game Boy** game *Fish Dude* and transform it into a gameplay experience inspired by the modern mobile hit *Hungry Shark*.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

**Fish Dude** is a 1990 Game Boy game featuring a small fish trying to survive in the ocean. This project aims to dissect the original game, understand its mechanics, and enhance it by introducing new gameplay elements, mechanics, and goals similar to the *Hungry Shark* series — where you grow by eating smaller fish and avoiding larger predators.

---

## 🚧 Project Goals

- ✅ Reverse engineer the *Fish Dude* ROM
- 🔍 Document original game logic (movement, AI, level structure, etc.)
- 🧠 Analyze memory layout, assets, and collision system
- ⚙️ Build tools or scripts to assist in ROM disassembly/modification
- 🎯 Add new gameplay elements:
  - Score/XP system
  - Growing fish mechanic
  - Predators and power-ups
  - Dynamic difficulty/scaling
- 📱 Make the game loop resemble *Hungry Shark*-style gameplay
- 💾 Optional: Port to other platforms or emulators with modern controls

## 🧠 Why This Project?

I've always been fascinated by retro games and how simple mechanics can be transformed into engaging experiences. By reimagining *Fish Dude* with *Hungry Shark*-style mechanics, I hope to learn more about low-level programming, game logic, and the art of ROM hacking.
